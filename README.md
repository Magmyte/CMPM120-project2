# CMPM 120 - Project 2
## Author: Charles Haiwen

This game is my submission for CMPM 120 Project 2: Gallery Shooter. The game is themed as a nautical shoot 'em up with the player character moving up and down while enemies approach from the right.

# Controls
- Use 'W' or the up arrow key to move up, and 'S' or the down arrow key to move down.
- Press or hold space to fire projectiles.

# Scoring Points
- Destroy enemies by shooting projectiles at them.
- Different enemies have different point values, but also different paths and can even shoot back.

# Bonus Elements
- Title page that includes controls and a visual demo of what those controls do.
- Two different levels, each labeled as a 'wave'.
- A high score that is saved per-session, which appears when the game ends (either with a game over or by winning the game).

# Assets Used
- The ocean background asset was created by KnoblePersona, and published on OpenGameArt.org under CC 3.0.
- All other visual and audio assets were taken from Kenney Game Assets and used under license.
